To test any of the examples here, first download GHCi, then run `GHCi` in the CLI.

If successful, run `:l <script_name>` to load the script/module you want to experiment/play with. 
then you can call the function name.

As an example:
```
:l types.hs
factorial 50 //returns 30414093201713378043612608166064768844377641568960512000000000000
